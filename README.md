# readme-gen
## Description 
Welcome to my Readme-Generator! This application offers a dynamically generated readme file with preset criteria that covers most of the essential elements of a basic README document. As a requirement to better access this application, I recommmend all users to install Node.js and Inquirer.js as it will be an essential portion to allow this application to even run. Hence, to get this application started, you will need to operate through your CLI(Terminal) and answer certain prompts that will dynimcally generate your defaulted readme file. 

Here is an example of what you can expect in your terminal!

## Learning Points

The development of this applicaiton allowed me to have a better understanding of different methods within 'Node.js' such as inquirer/file systems. Also applying the method of importing and exporting modules, which I personally felt helped organize my code and made it look neat in terms of what functions need to do what.
